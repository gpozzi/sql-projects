# 1. Scope

In this repository I will upload the projects submitted for the MySQL course taught by Duke University, taken in Coursera platform

# 2. Course Overview

The Coursera Specialization: Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business is about how “Big Data” interacts with business, and how to use data analytics to create value for businesses. The specialization consists of four courses and a capstone project. In this folder, I'll be posting projects from course 4: Managing Big Data With MySQL.

By the end of this course, I will be able to be a specialist in using Structured Query Language, or SQL, to retrieve and analyze big data from industrial-sized relational databases, by:

1.	Describing the structure of relational databases; 

2.	Interpreting and creating entity-relationship diagrams and relational schemas that describe the contents of specific databases; 

3.	Writing queries that retrieve and sort data that meet specific criteria, and retrieve such data from MySQL and Teradata databases that contain over 1 million rows of data; 

4.	Executing practices that limit the impact of your queries on other coworkers; 

5.	Summarizing rows of data using aggregate functions, and segmenting aggregations according to specified variables; 

6.	Combining and manipulating data from multiple tables across a database; 

7.	Retrieving records and compute calculations that are dependent on dynamic data features, and translating data analysis questions into SQL queries. 

# 3.  The data
